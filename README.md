# Secret Santa App 🎅

![screenshot](public/screenshot.png)

A simple tool for organizing Secret Santa gift exchanges with friends, family, or colleagues. Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a beautiful snow animation effect and a clean, responsive design.

Simply enter the names and emails of everyone participating in the gift exchange and the app will automatically randomize the assignments and send out personalized emails to each participant.

I created a script to automate this process for my friend group a few years ago. I've created this frontend as a personal portfolio project to stretch my frontend skills and to try out some new tools.

## Features ✨

- **Simple UI**: Just enter names and emails, and press "Send".
- **Email Integration**: Automated notifications using Resend to send the emails to each participant.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works seamlessly across all screen sizes.
- **Demo Mode**: Try out the app with a fake email to test out the flow.
